# Module 3 - Lab 4 - Exercise 2 - Test DLP Policies


You are now at the point in your pilot project where you want to test policies. You have decided to test a DLP policy related to emails that contain sensitive information. 


### Task 1 – Test a DLP Policy for Sensitive Emails

In the previous exercise, you created a custom DLP policy that searches emails for sensitive information related to IP addresses in your Adatum tenant. In this exercise, you will send an email with an IP address from Holly Dickson to Lynne Robbins.

1. Switch to the Client 1 VM (LON-CL1), in which you should still be logged into Microsoft 365 as Holly Dickson (**holly@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com)** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**. 

2. You will now send an email from Holly to Lynne; the email will contain an IP address. In **Microsoft Edge**, the **Outlook on the web** tab should still be open for Holly. Select the **Outlook on the web** tab.

3. In the upper left corner of the screen, select **+New message**. 

4. In the message pane that appears on the right-side of the screen, enter the following information:

	- To: start typing **Lynne** and a drop-down menu displays with users whose name begins with that. Select **Lynne Robbins**.

	- Add a subject: **DLP Policy Test**

	- Message area: type **I will configure this IP address: 192.168.0.1.**

5. Wait a moment until the message is saved as a draft, at which point a policy tip is displayed above your message fields in the right-hand pane.

6. Select **Send.**

7. You will now send a second message from Holly to Lynne that contains multiple IP addresses.   <br/>

	‎In **Outlook**, in the upper left corner of the screen, select **+New message**. 

8. In the message pane that appears on the right-side of the screen, enter the following information:

	- To: start typing **Lynne** and a drop-down menu displays with users whose name begins with that. Select **Lynne Robbins**.

	- Add a subject: **Second DLP Policy Test**

	- Message area: **Test the IP address 192.168.0.1 and then the IP address 172.16.0.1.**

9. Wait a moment until the message is saved as a draft. You will see a different policy tip displayed above your message fields. Select **Show details**.

10. Select **Override** to bypass the policy tip and send the message. Note the new Policy Tip message. 

11. Select **Send.**

12. Switch to the Client 2 VM (LON-CL2) in the **Virtual machine** field at the top of the VM. 

13. If you need to sign into the VM, the **Admin** account should appear by default, so enter **Pa55w.rd** in the **Password** field to log in. 

7. Switch to the Client 2 VM (LON-CL2) in the **Virtual machine** field at the top of the VM.

8. In the **Edge** browser, if there are still signed in sessions, sign out of the current user account and close all **Edge** browser tabs.

9. Open your **Edge** browser, maximize the window and enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://outlook.office365.com**

10. You want to sign into **Outlook on the web** as **Lynne Robbins.** If the **Pick an account** window appears, Lynne’s account won’t appear since she hasn’t signed in before. Therefore, select **Use another account**. 

11. In the **Sign in** window, enter **LynneR@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider) and then select **Next.**

12. In the **Enter password** window, enter **Pa55w.rd** and then select **Sign in**.

13. In the **Stay signed in?** window, select **Don’t show this again** and then select **Yes**.

14. If you approach the site for the first time, you will be asked for your language setting and your time zone:

	- From the **Language** dropdown select **English (United States).**

	- From the **Time zone** dropdown select your preferred time zone.

15. Select **Save**.

16. If a window is displayed asking whether you want to try the new outlook, select **Try the new Outlook.**

17. If a **Welcome** window appears, then close it now.

18. In **Outlook on the web**, in Lynne’s **Inbox**, you should see the email message that Holly just sent to Lynne.

15. In Lynne’s **Inbox**, you should see both messages that were just sent by Holly.

16. Delete both messages from Lynne’s Inbox as the last operation in this exercise. You have now successfully tested your custom DLP policy.

17. Leave both client VMs open for the next lab. Do not close any of the browser tabs.
