# Module 1 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Set Up Your Microsoft 365 Tenant 

In the following lab exercises you will take on the role of Holly Dickson, Adatum Corporation’s Security Administrator. Adatum runs their legacy applications (such as Microsoft Exchange) in an on-premises deployment. However, they recently subscribed to Microsoft 365, thereby creating a hybrid deployment in which they must synchronize their on-premises and cloud deployments. 

You have been tasked with deploying Microsoft 365 in Adatum’s hybrid deployment using a virtualized lab environment. In this lab, you will set up a Microsoft 365 trial tenant, add a custom on-premises accepted domain, install Azure Active Directory, and add several users and groups that will be used throughout the remainder to the labs in this course. 

In this lab, the trial tenant has already been selected and a default tenant admin account has already been created. In your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Security Administrator, you will be responsible for the remainder of the initial setup. You will log into the Domain Controller VM using the ADATUM\Administrator account, and when you access Microsoft 365 for the first time, you will initially log in using the tenant email account that has been assigned to your Microsoft 365 tenant. Once you create your Microsoft 365 account for Holly, you will log into Microsoft 365 as Holly from that point forward.


### Task 1 - Obtain Your Office 365 Credentials

Once you launch the lab, a free trial tenant will be made available to you to access Azure in the Microsoft Virtual Lab environment. This tenant will be automatically assigned a unique username and password. You must retrieve this username and password so that you can sign into Azure within the Microsoft Virtual Lab environment. You will also be assigned a unique network IP address and UPN name for your O365 blob. You will also use this UPN name in various tasks throughout the labs for this course.

1. Because this course can be offered by learning partners using any one of several authorized lab hosting providers, the actual steps involved to retrieve the UPN name, network IP address, and tenant ID associated with your tenant may vary by lab hosting provider. Therefore, your instructor will provide you with the necessary instructions on how to retrieve this information for your course. The information that you should note for later use includes:

	- **Tenant suffix ID.** This ID is for the onmicrosoft.com accounts that you will use to sign into Microsoft 365 throughout the labs. This is in the format of **{username}@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**, where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant suffix ID provided by your lab hosting provider. Record this ZZZZZZ value for later use. When any of the lab steps direct you to sign into the Office 365 or Microsoft 365 portals, you must enter the ZZZZZZ value that you obtained here.
	- **Tenant password.** This is the password for the admin account provided by your lab hosting provider.
	- **UPN name (in the format XXYYZZa) and the network IP address.** Write down the **IP Address** value (this is the IP Address of your parent domain; for example, 64.64.206.13), as well as your **UPN name** (for example, AVEAH2a).

### Task 2- Set up the Organization Profile

In your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Security Administrator, you have been tasked with setting up the company’s profile for its Microsoft 365 trial tenant. In this task, you will configure the required options for Adatum’s tenant. Since Holly has yet to create a personal Microsoft 365 user account (you will do this in Task 3), Holly will initially sign into Microsoft 365 as the default Microsoft 365 MOD Administrator account using the Tenant email address and password that was assigned by your lab hosting provider.

1. When the Virtual Machine opens, it opens with the Client PC VM (LON-CL1). You need to switch to the Domain Controller VM; therefore, in the **Virtual Machine** field at the top of the page, select the drop-down arrow an select the Domain Controller VM (LON-DC1).

2. At the top of the page is an **Actions** field. Select the drop-down arrow and select **Ctrl+Alt+Delete** to log on. Log on as **ADATUM\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**. 

3. If you receive a **Networks** warning message asking if you want this PC to be discoverable by other PCs and devices on this network, select **No.**

4. **Server Manager** will automatically start. Leave it open (it’s used in the next task) but minimize the window for now.

5. On the taskbar at the bottom of the page, select the **Internet Explorer** icon. Maximize your browser window when it opens.

6. In your browser go to the **Microsoft Office Home** page by entering the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.office.com/** 

7. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy and paste in the **Tenant Email** account provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Next**.

8. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy and paste in the **Tenant Password** provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**.

9. On the **Stay signed in?** dialog box, select the **Don’t show this again** checkbox and then select **Yes.**

10. If a **Get your work done with Office 365** type window appears, then close it now. 

11. If a **Set your time zone** window appears, select **set the time zone for your calendar**. In the **Outlook** window that opens, under **Time zone,** select your time zone and select **Save**, then close your browser window and re-open the **Microsoft Office Home** page by entering the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.office.com**.

12. In the Office 365 portal, select the **Install Office** drop-down, and then select **Office 365 apps.**

13. In the notification bar that appears at the bottom of the page, select the option to **Run** the setup program. Installation of the Office 365 apps will take around five minutes to complete, at which point, select **Close** in the dialog box once Office is installed.   

    **Note:** If you don’t want to wait for the Office 365 apps to complete, open a new tab in your browser and continue with the next steps while the installation continues.

14. In your browser goes to the **Microsoft Office Home** page by entering the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.office.com/** 

15. If a notification bar appears at the bottom of the screen for enabling the **Skype for Business Browser Helper add-on**, select **Don’t enable**. 

16. If a **Good morning/afternoon/evening MOD Administrator** window appears, select **Get started**.

17. In the **Microsoft Office Home** page, select the **Admin** app. This opens the **Microsoft 365 admin center.**

18. In the left navigation pane, select the **Show All** ellipsis … icon to display all the navigation menu options.

19. In the left navigation pane, select **Settings** and then select **Organization profile**.

20. In the **Organization Profile** window, it displays Contoso as the organization name. To the right of this, select the **pencil** (**Edit**) icon to change this information.   

    ‎**Note:** The Contoso organization name was explained in the Introduction section at the start of this lab. In the following steps, you will change it to Adatum Corporation. 

21. In the **Organization information** window, enter the following information:

	- Name: **Adatum Corporation**

	- Address: **555 Main Street**

	- City: **Redmond**

	- State: **Washington**

	- Postal Code: **98052**

	- Phone: **425-555-1234**

	- Technical contact: **admin@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** (where ZZZZZZ is your unique tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider)

	- Preferred language: **select your preferred language**

22. Select **Save**.

23. On the **Organization information** window, select **Close.**

24. To the right of **Release preferences**, select the **pencil** (**Edit**) icon.

25. In the **Release preferences** window, select **Targeted release for selected users** and then select **Next.**  

    ‎**Note:** One of the benefits of Office 365 is the ability to have the latest features and updates applied to your environment automatically, which can reduce maintenance costs and overhead for an organization. By setting up your Release preferences, you can control how and when your Office 365 tenant receives these updates.

26. In the **Are you sure you want to change to Targeted release for select people** window, select **Yes.**  <br/>

    **Note:** This option enables you to create a control group of users who will preview updates so that you can prepare the updates for your entire organization. The **Targeted release for everyone** option is more commonly used in development environments, where you can get updates early for your entire organization. In non-development environments, such as Adatum, targeted release to select people is the more typical preference as it enables an organization to control when it wants to make updates available to everyone once they’ve been reviewed by the control group.

27. In the **Release preferences** window, select **Add people.**

28. In the **Manage people for First** **release** window, in the list of users, select the checkbox for **MOD Administrator** and then select **Save**.

29. Select **Close**, and then select **Close** again. This returns you to the **Organization Profile** window.

30. To the right of **Manage custom themes for your organization**, select the **pencil** (**Edit**) icon.

31. In the **Customize Office 365 for your organization** window, you can add the logo of your company and set the background image as the default for all your users. Along with these options you can change the colors for your navigation pane, text color, icon color, and accent color. Go ahead and explore some different options for your tenant. Make any changes that you wish. <br/>

    **Note:** Some colors patterns aesthetically distract users. Avoid using high contrasting colors together, such as neon colors and high-resolution colors like white and bright pink.

32. Once you’re done exploring and making any further changes, select **Save** and then **Close**.

33. Remain logged into the domain controller VM and in Internet Explorer, leave your Microsoft 365 admin center tab and all tabs open for the remaining tasks. 
 



### Task 3 - Create Office 365 User Accounts 

Holly Dickson is Adatum’s Security Administrator. Since she doesn’t have a personal Microsoft 365 user account set up for herself, Holly initially signed into Microsoft 365 as the default Microsoft 365 MOD Administrator account. In this task, she will create a Microsoft 365 user account for herself, and she will assign her user account the Microsoft 365 Global Administrator role, which gives her the ability to perform all administrative functions within Microsoft 365.

‎You will then create several additional user accounts in the Microsoft 365 admin center, each of which you will later add to new security groups that you’ll also create. While Security Admins typically do not add user accounts, this is a one-time task that you need to perform to prepare Adatum’s test environment for future lab exercises in this course.

**Important:** As a best practice in your real-world deployments, you should always write down the first global admin account’s credentials (in this lab, the MOD Administrator) and store it away for security reasons. This account is a non-personalized identity that owns the highest privileges possible in a tenant. It is **not** MFA activated (because it is not personalized) and the password for this account is typically shared among several users. Therefore, this first global admin is a perfect target for attacks, so it’s always recommended to create personalized service admins and keep as few global admins as possible. For those global admins that you do create, they should each be mapped to a single identity, and they should each have MFA enforced.

1. On the LON-DC1 VM, the **Microsoft 365 admin center** should still be open in Internet Explorer from the prior task. In the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left navigation pane, select **Users** and then select **Active users**. 

2. In the **Active users** list, you will see the  the default **MOD Administrator** account as well as some other user accounts. Since you’re taking on the role of Holly Dickson in this lab scenario, you will create a user account for yourself, and you will assign yourself the Microsoft 365 role of Global Administrator. 

3. In the **Active Users** window, select **Add a user**. 

4. In the **Set up the basics** window, enter the following information:

	- First name: **Holly**

	- Last name: **Dickson** 

	- Display name: When you tab into this field, **Holly Dickson** will appear.

	- Username: When you tab into this field, **Holly** will appear; leave this as the username
	
		‎**IMPORTANT:** To the right of the **Username** field is the domain field. It’s already prefilled with the custom **XXYYZZa.CustomDomain.us** on-premises domain; however, you must select the drop-down arrow and select the **M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com** cloud domain instead (where ZZZZZZ is your tenant ID provided by your lab hosting provider).
	
		After configuring this field, Holly’s username should appear as:

		**Holly@M365xZZZZZZ.onmicrosoft.com**  
	
	- Password settings: select the **Let me create the password** option

	- Password: **Pa55w.rd** 

	- Uncheck the **Make this user change their password when they first sign in** checkbox 

5. Select **Next**.

6. In the **Assign product licenses** window, enter the following information:

	- Select location: **United States**

	- Licenses: Under **Assign user a product license**, select **Office 365 E5** 

7. Select **Next.**

8. In the **Optional settings** window, select the drop-down arrow to the right of **Roles.** 

9. In the **Roles information** that appears, uncheck **User (no administrator access).** By doing so, all the Microsoft 365 administrator roles are now enabled and available to be assigned.

10. Select **Global Administrator** and then select **Next**.

11. On the **You’re almost done – review and finish adding** window, review your selections. If anything needs to be changed, select the appropriate **Edit** link and make the necessary changes. Otherwise, if everything is correct, select **Finish adding**. 

12. On the **Holly Dickson has been added** page, select **Close.** 
‎
14. Remain logged into the domain controller VM with the Microsoft 365 admin center open in your browser for the next task.





### Task 4 – Prepare for Microsoft Azure Active Directory 

Azure Active Directory is needed to perform several configuration steps when installing Microsoft 365. These steps are performed using Windows PowerShell. However, before you can use PowerShell to access Azure AD, you must first install the Windows PowerShell modules that enable you to access Azure AD through PowerShell. In this task, you will prepare for using Azure AD by installing those PowerShell modules.

1. On the LON-DC1 VM, in Internet Explorer, enter the following URL in the address bar: **http://aka.ms/AA70s3f**   

    ‎This will take you to the **Microsoft Download Center** for the **Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant for IT Professionals RTW.**

2. Scroll down on the page and under **Microsoft Online Services Sign-In Assistant for IT Professionals RTW**, verify that English is selected as your **Language,** and then select **Download**. 

3. On the **Choose the download you want** page, select the **64 bit** version check box, and then select **Next**. 

4. If a notification bar appears at the bottom of the page indicating that Internet Explorer blocked a pop-up from www.microsoft.com, select **Allow once**.

5. In the notification bar that appears at the bottom of the page asking whether you want to Run or Save the setup program from the Download Center, select **Run**. 

6. In the **Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant Setup** wizard, select **I accept the terms in the License Agreement and Privacy Statement**, and then select **Install**. 

7. On the **Completed the Microsoft Online Services Sign-in Assistant Setup Wizard** page, select **Finish**. 

8. Close this tab in Internet Explorer. 

9. If Windows PowerShell is still open from the earlier task (see the Windows PowerShell icon on the taskbar), then proceed to the next step. Otherwise, you must open **Windows PowerShell** by performing the following steps:

	- Select the magnifying glass (Search Windows) icon on the taskbar at the bottom of the screen and type **powershell** in the Search box that appears. 

	- In the menu that appears, right-click on **Windows PowerShell** and select **Run as administrator** in the drop-down menu. 

10. In **Windows PowerShell**, type the following command and then press Enter:

	‎**Install-Module MSOnline** 
	
11. If you are prompted to install the **NuGet provider**, enter **Y** to select **[Y] Yes**.  

12. If you are prompted to install the module from **PSGallery,** enter **A** to select **[A] Yes to All.** 

13. Once the installation is complete, the screen will return to the Windows PowerShell command prompt.

14. You must then run the following command to install the Azure AD PowerShell module that you just retrieved in the earlier step:

	**Install-Module AzureADPreview**   
	
15. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to execute this command, enter **A** to select **[A] Yes to All**.

16. You have now installed the Windows PowerShell modules required to access Azure AD.

17. Remain logged into the domain controller VM and keep the Windows PowerShell window open.
